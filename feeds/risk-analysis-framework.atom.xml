&lt;p&gt;According to Al-Ahmad and Mohammad, no single security framework addresses information security risks adequately.  Organizations face challenges that hinder their risk analysis and try to adopt the best security practices of different frameworks in their assessments.  Similar to NIST, all other frameworks have their strengths and weaknesses in the major functions to identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover.  In the major function to identify within an organization, risk analysis and risk management strategies have several subcategories that NIST does not address solely.  The NIST frame depends on other standards and frameworks like COBIT 5, ISO 27001, and ISA 62440 to provide information in sub-categories like identifying asset vulnerabilities, identifying threats, establishing risk management processes, determining risk tolerance, identifying business impacts, and several others.  When NIST is limited in scope, other frameworks like COBIT and ITIL are preferred since they are more general in nature.  The purpose of the NIST framework was to provide the minimum level of information security requirements for government agencies (Schroeder, n.d.).  The major strength of the framework is that it has a robust catalog of documentation and has a solid foundation since it has been developed over time as technology has progressed.  That major weakness is that the framework doesn’t provide a lot of financial information in the NIST documents.  Organizations choose NIST when an in-depth understanding of controls is necessary and if the organization needs to comply with any US Government regulations.  This focus leaves gaps in the framework for other frameworks like ISO 27002, COBIT, or ITIL to fill.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Institute of Standards and Technology has provided specific guidelines on securing web servers.  NIST 800-44 was designed as a framework for, “federal departments and agencies, state agencies, and commercial organizations in installing, configuring, and maintaining secure public Web servers.  It presents generic security principles and covers details specific to the various components of Web content, Web applications, and Web servers (Tracy, Jansen &amp;amp; LcLarnon, 2017).” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framework recommended mitigation strategies on web server attacks consist of a large checklist provided by NIST 800-44 Appendix E. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk management is the process of identifying and mitigating threats and risks within an organization.  By understanding these risks, an organization can better protect their assets and minimize financial loss.  In general, there are strategic risks, compliance risks, operational risks, financial risks, and reputational risks that can negatively affect a business (Blackman, 2014).  Every successful organization has a strategic business plan that at times must change due to circumstances.  The changes and effects of that plan leave opportunity for risks.  Risks could negatively affect the strategic goals of the organization like establishing business partnerships, institutional standing, institutional culture of compliance, and advancement strategy.  Organizations need to ensure that they are complying with all laws and regulations.  Things within an organization and laws change.  Not understanding the different compliances as the organization changes leave opportunity for compliance risks.  Examples of compliance risks include contractual agreements with leases or sponsors, regulatory and statutory compliance, industry standards, research grants and contracts, and certifications.  Organizations have to handle their daily processes that achieve business goals.  When those daily tasks fail, it leaves opportunities for operational risks.  Operational risks include computing systems, data security, data management, personnel or even safety.  When organizations have to manage money, there is a possibility of a financial loss and other risks.  Financial risks include penalties and sanctions, loss of revenue, or lawsuits and other damages.  Finally, reputational risks include being labels as an organization that fails to manage effectively compliance, financial operations, or strategic risks.  It could impact the reputation and public image with investors and other customers ("Potential Areas of Risk | Finance", 2017).  Fortunately, there are different risk management frameworks that can be applied to the work environment and help identify, analyze, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks.  &lt;/p&gt;
