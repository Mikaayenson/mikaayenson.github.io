<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>E-mail in day-to-day business is an essential capability that empowers employees to communicate internally and externally.  Users receive updates, share documents, receive alerts, organize meetings, share information, and many other things without having to physically meet or call people they want to communicate with.  When e-mails are received, there is a level of trust that the sender is who the mail server says they are.  This trust factor and other technical aspects of mail servers are unfortunately exploited and give adversaries different attack vectors.  In this blog, the client and server fundamentals, examples of e-mail crime committed, vulnerabilities associated with emails, spoofing, tools used to investigate e-mail cybercrime, and laws to fight email cybercrime are discussed.  </p>
<h3>Server and Client Involved in Email Communication</h3>
<p>The mail server and endpoint client are the two main nodes used in email communication.  The mail server sends e-mails between endpoints and other mail servers, receives e-mails from endpoints, and stores e-mails for user endpoints.  Mail servers and user endpoints are configured to use the same protocol whether it is POP3, IMAP, SMTP, or HTTP ("Setting Up Mail Servers in Outlook Express", 2017).  The client machines typically send, receive, and store e-mails on endpoints like mobile devices and computers.  From endpoint to endpoint, e-mail must connect to at least one mail server.  Users can use software like Microsoft outlook to send the e-mail, the e-mail is sent to a Microsoft Exchange server, and then ends ultimately at another users e-mail.  </p>
<h3>Four Examples of Crime Committed by Sending E-mails</h3>
<p>By sending malicious e-mails perpetrators can commit crimes in multiple ways.  Four examples of e-mail crimes are e-mail bombing, e-mails involving threating extortion, e-mail fraud, and maliciously spreading malware.  According to US-CERT, e-mail bombing is when an individual repeatedly sends e-mails targeted at a victim with typically a large and meaningless amount of data ("Email Bombing Spamming", 2017).  The goal of the adversary is to consume a large amount of the victim’s data and network resources.</p>
<p>Another example is when computer criminals send threatening e-mails to victims in attempt to extort them.  According to the FBI in 2007, life-threatening e-mails started to trend online that attempted to scare victims into paying thousands on dollars (Online Extortion, 2007).  Although the Internet Crime Complaint Center didn’t report and financial loss for the victims, the act of sending malicious e-mails itself was still a crime.</p>
<p>Spreading malware through e-mails is also a computer crime ("Report Phishing Sites", 2017).  Typically this is sent as a phishing attempt where the adversary tries to trick the victim into opening a file or downloaded and executing a windows binary.  The adversary typically claims that the file is an urgent update and must be executed.</p>
<p>Lastly, in 2016 the IRS reported e-mail being used fraudulently to send e-mails claiming they were apart of the IRS team so that users would send their personal information (IRS News Releases, 2016).  This was not exactly a spoofing attempt but a few characteristics were similar.  For example, the perpetrator included images that resembled the IRS logos, and posed as the IRS by saying “Your eServices Team” in the from header.</p>
<p>As a safe precaution, if any e-mails appear suspicious, users can analyze the e-mails headers to verify the e-mails authenticity.</p>

<h3>Four Examples of Crimes Supported by E-mails</h3>
<p>There are several different e-mail crimes that are supported through e-mails like harassment, blackmailing, identity fraud, and even sharing classified information.  When people send threatening e-mails they are cyber bullying.  Similar to bullying in general, when people bully victims through e-mail, they are breaking cyber harassment laws.  Similarly, blackmail through e-mail is another supported crime.  Blackmail just like harassment is when individuals direct threating or abusive messages to another individual.  Blackmail extends the crime by extorting the victim.  Identity fraud is a supported by e-mails by being apart of the attack strategy.  Criminals send e-mails either to individuals or businesses posing as another person to steal personal data or defraud another individual.  An example of this is when a person sends an e-mail to a bank posing as another individual to gain access to their bank account.  Finally, something as egregious espionage is supported through e-mail.  For example, if an individual’s sends classified documents from the secret internet protocol router network to the non-classified internet protocol router network, they are committing a cyber crime.  </p>
<h3>E-mail Spoofing</h3>
<p>Another example of crime supported by e-mails that are committed by sending an e-mail is called e-mail spoofing.  Adversaries sometimes use simple tactics to spoof e-mails and sometimes simply just say that they are someone in the e-mail that they really are not.  E-mail spoofing is not the same thing as forging, where an individual sends an e-mail with header information that appears to originate from a source that is not the actually source.  E-mail addresses can be spoofed, the content of the e-mail can be faked, and the headers can be forged ("Spoofed/Forged Email", 2017).  Each tactic is used to trick the user into revealing sensitive information to the attacker.</p>
<h3>Common Invesigative E-mail Cybercrime Tools Table</h3>
<p>Other than looking at header information directly, there are several tools that help investigators in e-mail cybercrime like eMailTrackerPro, EmailTracer, Adcomplain, Aid4Mail Forensic, AbusePipe, AccessData’s FTK, EnCase Forensic, FINALeMAIL, Forensics Investigation Toolkit (FIT), and Paraben (Network) E-mail Examiner (Tariq Banday, 2011).  </p>

<h3>Two US laws Fighting Against E-mail Cybercrime</h3>
<p>Two laws that help the United States fight against e-mail cyber are the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA), and the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2008 (ITERA).  ITERA was created to increase federal prosecution for identity theft related crimes and help the victims by providing restitution for the victims ("H.R.4718 - 99th Congress (1985-1986): Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986", 2017).  CFAA was created to persecute criminals that intentionally committed computer fraud ("Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2007 (2007 - S.  2168)", 2017).  Although ITERA applies to identity theft in general, both of these laws also apply to cybercrimes including e-mail related crimes.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>When e-mail capabilities are used in an organization, there are several different components to consider when trying protecting a business from adversaries.  There is the server and client that must be created and properly configured, different threat vectors that adversaries can use to attack individuals, tools and techniques used to investigate e-mail related crimes, and finally laws that are designed to protect against e-mail related computer crimes.  Each of these areas has to be properly assessed to mitigate cyber crimes within the business.</p>
