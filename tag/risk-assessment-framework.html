<p>Risk management is the process of identifying and mitigating threats and risks within an organization.  By understanding these risks, an organization can better protect their assets and minimize financial loss.  In general, there are strategic risks, compliance risks, operational risks, financial risks, and reputational risks that can negatively affect a business (Blackman, 2014).  Every successful organization has a strategic business plan that at times must change due to circumstances.  The changes and effects of that plan leave opportunity for risks.  Risks could negatively affect the strategic goals of the organization like establishing business partnerships, institutional standing, institutional culture of compliance, and advancement strategy.  Organizations need to ensure that they are complying with all laws and regulations.  Things within an organization and laws change.  Not understanding the different compliances as the organization changes leave opportunity for compliance risks.  Examples of compliance risks include contractual agreements with leases or sponsors, regulatory and statutory compliance, industry standards, research grants and contracts, and certifications.  Organizations have to handle their daily processes that achieve business goals.  When those daily tasks fail, it leaves opportunities for operational risks.  Operational risks include computing systems, data security, data management, personnel or even safety.  When organizations have to manage money, there is a possibility of a financial loss and other risks.  Financial risks include penalties and sanctions, loss of revenue, or lawsuits and other damages.  Finally, reputational risks include being labels as an organization that fails to manage effectively compliance, financial operations, or strategic risks.  It could impact the reputation and public image with investors and other customers ("Potential Areas of Risk | Finance", 2017).  Fortunately, there are different risk management frameworks that can be applied to the work environment and help identify, analyze, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks.  </p>
